# Hi, I'm Andrew | Èô≥ÂøÉÂÆá

> [!note] Hi visitors, this site is still a work in progress so many things may be missing :)

Welcome to my home on the internet üçµ

I'm an engineer working to find my creative expression through writing. 

Found here are the various thought trails I collected from voyaging through life, trails that would continue to branch off and grow alongside my own evolution as a person.

I thought a lot about <span id="pkm-thought" class="inline-telescopic"></span> led me into the <s>rabbithole</s> space of [[personal knowledge management]]. It's something I came to be deeply passionate about, as the community and ideas helped change the way I co-exist with the information around me. 

Professionally I'm a software developer, previously <span id="career-experience" class="inline-telescopic"></span>. 
On the side, I am a big lover of table top games and indie games. Only recently I (re-)discovered the fun in making things (list of creations)
