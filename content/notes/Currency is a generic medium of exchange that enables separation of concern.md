Currency is a generic medium of exchange that facilitates separation of concern
- There's no need for a Boba shop worker to know how a car is made in order to purchase a car

Economy ([[Market]]) is the system that allows this pairing without any personal connection
- With analogy to [[Cohesion and Coupling]], money circulating within an industry/trade enables high cohesion for people within the trade (co-workers, conferences) but low coupling across trades (other industry)

Consequence: Sphere of trade and human activity can grow
- Today you can trade little neat necklaces or even meme coins, and somehow the money you get from those trade allows you to have food in your mouth
